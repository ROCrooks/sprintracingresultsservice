# sprintracingresultsservice
A database software for managing canoe sprint racing results

The online version of this database is found at https://www.rocrooks.co.uk/srrs/

The intention is that this Git repository will host the engines used to access and present these results data, allowing users outside the GB sprint canoeing world to use this software for their own results services. Please be patient while I generalise these engines to add them to the Git, as many of them predate my own use of Git, and I do this in my spare time.
